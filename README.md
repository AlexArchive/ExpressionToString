# ExpressionToString
Expression.ToString() is not so nice to look at sometimes. ExpressionToString turns Turns `() => (value(UserQuery+&lt;>c__DisplayClass0).foo == 1)` into `() => foo == 1` as you would expect

## Install
A source only package is available on NuGet (no binary dependency, just a single class)

 > Install-Package ExpressionToString
 
 Or visit https://www.nuget.org/packages/ExpressionToString
